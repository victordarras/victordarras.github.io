# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

          #
          # You can use whatever directory your project uses,
          # for example "wwwroot" (without leading "./").
          # Such a directory does *not* have to already exist in your repo,
          # it could be an output directory created dynamically
          # by your static website builder.
